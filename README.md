## Frontend repository

SvelteKit project which provides an awesome 3D view on the data generated by our API.
Upload a CSV dataset in the top bar, then start the simulation, and pay special attention to
the right-bottom events panel.
Note that while the app recieves the full demo before playing, there is nothing in a tick
that depends on any future ones.
